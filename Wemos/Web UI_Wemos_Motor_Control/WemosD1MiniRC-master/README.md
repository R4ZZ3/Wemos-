There are two folders : "Arduino" and "Server". Arduino contains the sketch that you should download to your Wemos D1 Mini, while "Server" contains the source code for the remote control (made in PHP, to be hosted on a website). The two scripts communicate through reading and writing a "cmd.txt" file hosted on the same server.
